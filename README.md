# Blog Website

This week's project is to create a website for content management. We’ll create a content-centered website that will use a headless CMS as its content “base”. From the lesson: And to make the editing experience great, so we have an easier time publishing, and other people can contribute to the blog without being developers, we’ll use Sanity.

Sanity is a “content platform”. They provide a content management system we can hook in our Next.js website.

## Initial Setup

1. Initial setup of Next.js is the same as prior weeks. The completed project for reference is here: https://github.com/flaviocopes/bootcamp-2022-week-15-blog
2. There is no authentication added to the project.
